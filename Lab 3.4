%In this activity you will utilize MATLAB to evaluate the dot product of two vectors in two 
%different ways, using the dot() command and using matrix multiplication.

%Note:  A vector is an ordered n-tuple which may be represented as a matrix in the form of
%a column vector (nx1 matrix) or a row vector (1xn matrix).

%In this activity you will work with the vectors x and y in two different forms.  Create the 
%column vectors xc and yc.  Create the row vectors xr and yr.
xc = [1; 2; 3]
yc = [2; 2; 2]
xr = [1 2 3]
yr = [2 2 2]

%Use the dot() command to find the dot product of vectors x and y.  Note the result is the same
%whether the dot product is found using the associated row vectors or column vectors.
zc = dot(xc, yc)
zr = dot(xr, yr)

%Use the appropriate transpose when calcuating the dot product of x and y using matrix multiplication.
%Note the result is the same whether it is found using the associated row vectors or column vectors.
zdc = xc.' * yc
zdr = xr * yr.'


Script:
%Create the row vectors a=[1, -2, 0, 7] and b=[-3, -1, 5, 0].
a = [ 1, -2, 0, 7]
b = [ -3, -1, 5, 0]
%Create the column vectors c=[3, 1, 4, -2] and d=[0, -2, 2, 1].
c = [ 3; 1; 4; -2]
d = [ 0; -2; 2; 1]
%Use the dot() command to find the dot product of vectors a and b.  Store this value in g1. 
g1 = dot(a, b);
%Use matrix multiplication to find the dot product of vectors a and b.  Store this value in g2.
g2 = a * b';
%Use the dot() command to find the dot product of vectors c and d.  Store this value in h1. 
h1 = dot(c, d);
%Use matrix multiplication to find the dot product of vectors c and d.  Store this value in h2.
h2 = c' * d;
