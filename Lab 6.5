In this activity you will find the matrix P that diagonalizes a given matrix and the resulting diagonal matrix D, and utilize these to indirectly find a higher power of the given matrix.
Consider the matrix A.

A = [ 1 1 ]
      -2 4          
Higher powers of A can be found indirectly using the diagonalization matrix P and resulting diagonal matrix D.  These matrices were
found using the eig() command in zyLab 6.2.  The matrix A to the kth power can be indirectly calculated by .
A = [1 1; -2 4]
[P, D] = eig(A)

%Indirectly find A^5 using P and D.  The command power(D,5) raises every element in the diagonal matrix D 
%to the fifth power.  
A5indirectly = P*power(D,5)*inv(P)

%The same result can be found directly, but the direct method is not computationally practical for higher powers.
A5directly = A^5
Use the following matrix for this activity.

      1 2 2 
C = [ 2 1 2 ]
      2 2 1 


%Enter matrix C.
C = [1 2 2; 2 1 2; 2 2 1]
%Use the eig() command to find the matrix P that diagonalizes C and the resulting diagonal 
%matrix D.  Store these in P and D, respectively.
[P, D] = eig(C)
%Indirectly find C^4, using P and D, and using the power() command on D.  Store the result in C4.
C4 = P * power(D,4) * inv(P)
