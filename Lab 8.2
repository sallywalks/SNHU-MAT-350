%Consider the matrix A.  Since A is not a square matrix the inverse does not exist.  However,
%the pseudoinverse of A will exist.
A = [1 -2; 0 1; 1 0]

%The command pinv() returns the pseudoinverse of the matrix A.
B = pinv(A)

%Use the following matrix for this activity.
       1 2 0
B = [ -1 -2 3 ]


%Enter the matrix B.
B = [ 1 2 0; -1 -2 3]
%Find the pseudoinverse of the matrix B.  Store in in Bpinv.
Bpinv = [ .2 0; .4 0; .333 .333]
%Check that B=B*Bpinv*B.  Store the product in Bcheck.
Bcheck = B*Bpinv*B
