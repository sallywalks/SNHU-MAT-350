%In this activity you will find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a square matrix.

%Consider the following matrix.
A = [3 1 0; 0 3 1; 0 0 3]

%Use the command poly() to find the characteristic polynomial.
CharacteristicPoly = poly(A)

%Use the command roots() to find the eigenvalues.
eigenvalues = roots(CharacteristicPoly)

%The eig() command returns diagonal matrix D of eigenvalues and matrix V whose 
%columns are the corresponding eigenvectors.  For example, the value on the diagional
%in the first column of D is the eigenvalue associated with the eigenvector in the first 
%column of V.  The eigenvectors in V are normalized, each having a magnitude of 1.
[V, D] = eig(A)

Use the following matrix C for this activity.


      6  3 8 
C = [ 0 -2 0 ]
      1  0 -3



%Enter the matrix C.
C = [6 3 -8; 0 -2 0; 1 0 -3]
%Find the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial.  Store them in PolyCoeffs.
PolyCoeffs = poly(C)
%Use the command roots() to find the eigenvalues.  Store them in evals.
evals = roots(PolyCoeffs)
%Use the eig() command.  Store the eigenvalues in matrix eigDiag.  Store the associated
%eigenvectors in eigV.
[eigV, eigDiag] = eig(C)
