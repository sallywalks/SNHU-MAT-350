%Use the qr() command to find the QR factorization of A, where Q is an orthogonal matrix
%and R is an upper triangular matrix. 
A = [-2 0 3; 1 3 1; 0 1 -1]
[Q, R] = qr(A)

%Verify QR=A.

%Use the following matrix for this activity.

      1 0 3 -1
B = [ -2 1 0 5 ]
       0 0 1 7


%Enter the matrix B.  Then use the qr() command to find the QR factorization of B, storing
%the orthogonal matrix in QB and the upper triangular matrix in RB.  Note that while the focus
%of the last section of the zyBook was on square matrices, QR factorization can be done for
%any size matrix.
B = [ 1 0 3 -1; -2 1 0 5; 0 0 1 7]
[QB, RB] = qr(B);
%Verify the result.  Find the product of QB and RB, storing it in checkB.  This matrix should
%equal the original matrix B.
checkB = QB * RB;
