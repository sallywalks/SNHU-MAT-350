%In this activity you will find the cross product of two vectors in 3-space and apply appropriate
%MATLAB commands to find the area of a parallelepiped (cross(), dot(), and abs()).

%Recall that a vector is an ordered n-tuple which may be represented as a row or column vector.
%Define the three vectors u=[3, 2, 1], v=[-1, 3, 0], and w=[2, 2, 5].
u = [3 2 1]
v = [-1 3 0]
w = [2 2 5]

%Use the cross() command to find the cross product of vectors v and w.  The cross product is only
%defined for vectors in 3-space.
ans1 = cross(v,w)

%The volume of a parallelepiped determined by three vectors is the absolute value of the scalar 
%triple product of the three vectors.  The abs() command finds the absolute value of its argument.
%Find the volume of the parallelepiped defined by u, v, and w.
ans2 = abs(dot(u,cross(v,w)))


Script:
%Define the three vectors u=[1, 0, -4], v=[3, -3, 1], and w=[0, 2, 1].
u = [1, 0, -4]
v = [3, -3, 1]
w = [0, 2, 1]
%Find the cross product of u and w.  Store it in a1.
a1 = cross(u,w);
%Find the cross product of w and u.  Store it in a2.  Reversing the order of the cross product
%results in a vector of the same length but opposite direction.  Note that a2 = -1(a1).
a2 = cross(w,u);
%Find the volume of the parallelepiped determined by vectors u, v, and w.  Store this value in z.
z = abs(dot(u,cross(v,w)))
