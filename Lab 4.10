In this activity you will find the change of coordinates matrix from one basis to another basis.
Consider these two ordered sets of vectors, each a basis for .
                    
%Each basis can be represented by a matrix whose columns are the vectors in the basis.
B = {[2 ] , [ -4]}    C = { [4 ] , [2 ] }
     -4      -6              -1     3



%To find the change of coordinates matrix from basis B to basis C, set up the augmented
%matrix [C | B].
augCB = [C B]

%Row reduce the augmented matrix to get [I | P_BtoC].
temp = rref(augCB)

%The change of coordinates matrix from basis B to basis C is the matrix that appears to the 
%right of the identity matrix in the augmented matrix.
P_BtoC = temp(:,3:4)

Utilize the following ordered sets of vectors, each which represents a basis for , for this activity.

        1       2       1                1       2       1
B = { [ 1 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 2 ] }   C = { [ -1 ] , [ 0 ] , [ 2 ] }
        2       -1      1                1       1      -1



%Store the ordered basis vectors for the set B in the matrix B.
B = [1, 2, 1; 1, 4, 2; 2, -1, 1]
%Store the ordered basis vectors for the set C in the matrix C.
C = [1, 2, 1; -1, 0, 2; 1, 1, -1]
%Store the augmented matrix [C | B] in tempCB.
tempCB = [C B]
disp(tempCB)
%Row reduce the augmented matrix tempCB to get [I | P_BtoC].  Store the reduced matrix in temp_reduced.
temp_reduced = rref(tempCB)
disp(temp_reduced)
%Store the change of coordinates matrix from basis B to basis C in P_BtoC.
P_BtoC = temp_reduced(:, 4:6);
disp(P_BtoC)
