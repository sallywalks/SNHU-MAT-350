%In this activity you will utilize MATLAB to evaluate sums, differences, scalar 
%products, and products of matrices.

%Create the matrices A and B.
A = [2 1; 0 -4]
B = [1 -1; 3 2]

%WARNING:  Matrix operations are only possible on matrices of the appropriate sizes.

%Find the sum of A and B.
A + B
%Find the difference of A and B.
A - B
%Find the scalar product of 2 times A.
2*A
%Find the product of A and B.
A*B

Use the following matrices for this activity.
A = 1 2 0   B = -2 0 3   C = 3 1
  -1 -2 -3       1 3 1       2 -1
                 0 1 -1      -1 0

Scrpit:
%Create the matrices A, B, and C.
A = [ 1 2 0; -1 -2 3]
B = [ -2 0 3; 1 3 1; 0 1 -1]
C = [ 3 1; 2 -1; -1 0]
%WARNING:  Matrix operations are only possible using matrices of the appropriate sizes.

%Find the scalar product of 2 times A.  Store this product in Ans1. 
Ans1 = [ 2 4 0; -2 -4 6]
%Find the product of A and B.  Store this product in Ans2.
Ans2 = [ 0 6 5; 0 -3 -8]
%Use the appropriate identity matrix to find the sum of Ans2 and AI.  Store this product in Ans3 
Ans3 = [ 0 6 5; 0 -3 -8] + [ 1 2 0; -1 -2 3]
Ans3 = [ 1 8 5; -1 -5 -5]
%Use the appropriate identity matrix to find CI minus 2 times the transpose of Ans2.  Store 
%this product in Ans4.
Ans4 = [ 3 1; -10 5; -11 16 ]
