%Consider the column vector v.  The norm() command is used to find the Euclidean norm,
%the 4-norm, and the infinity-norm.
v = [-4; 3]
two_norm = norm(v, 2)
four_norm = norm(v, 4)
infinity_norm = norm(v, Inf)

%Consider the matrix A.  The norm() command is used to find the Frobenius norm.
A = [1/sqrt(6) 0; -2/sqrt(6) 1/sqrt(6)] 
fro_norm = norm(A, 'fro')
Use the following vectors and matrices for this activity.

u = [ 4 ] , v = [ -4 ] , A = [ 3 -7 4 3 ] , B = [ 1 -7 2 5 ]
      3          -12           -2 4 -5 0          0  0 -5 2


%To find the Euclidean distance between two vectors, find the 2-norm of the difference of 
%those vectors.  Enter column vectors u and v.  Then use the norm() command to find d(u,v), storing 
%it in dist_uv.
u = [4 ; 3]
v = [-4 ; -12]
dist_uv = norm(u-v, 2);
%To find the distance between two matrices with respect to the Frobenius inner product, 
%find the Frobenius norm of the difference of those matrices.  Enter matrices A and B.  
%Then use the norm() command to find d(A,B), storing it in dist_AB.
A = [3 -7 4 3; -2 4 -5 0]
B = [1 -7 2 5; 0 0 -5 2]
dist_AB = norm(A-B, 'fro');
