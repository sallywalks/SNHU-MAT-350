%Recall vectors are ordered n-tuples that can be represented as row or column vectors. 
v1 = [2 -1 -1 1 3]
v2 = [-3 2 5 1 3]
v3 = [7 -4 -7 1 3]

%Create a matrix C with the given vectors placed in the columns of C.
C = [v1.' v2.' v3.']

%Create the appropriately sized identity matrix, storing it in I.
I = eye(5)

%Augment C with the identity matrix.
augC = [C I]

%Row reduce augC.  
B = rref(augC)

%The pivot columns of the reduced matrix are used to identify which of the original vectors 
%are included in the basis, along with which columns of the identity matrix are included in the basis. 

%Create a matrix containing the basis vectors.  For this example, the first two vectors, namely v1 and v2,
%are linearly independent vectors from the given set.  Those two vectors combined with the 1st,
%2nd, and 4th columns of the identity matrix form a linearly indpendent set of vectors that spans 5-space.
BasisMatrix = [v1.' v2.' I(:,1) I(:,2) I(:,4)]
Utilize the following set of vectors in  for this activity.

      1           -3          -1          0
v1 = [-2 ]  v2 = [ 5 ]  v3 = [1 ]  v4 = [ -1 ]
      2            -2         2           4
     -1            2          0           -1


 %Enter vectors v1, v2, v3, and v4.
v1 = [1, -2, 2, -1]
v2 = [-3, 5, -2, 2]
v3 = [-1, 1, 2, 0]
v4 = [0, -1, 4, -1]
%Create a matrix A with the given vectors placed in the columns of A.
A = [v1', v2', v3', v4'];
disp(A)
%Create the appropriately sized identity matrix, storing it in I.
I = eye(size(A, 1));
disp(I)
%Augment A with the identity matrix, storing it in augA.
augA = [A, I];
disp(augA)
%Row reduce augA, storing it in reduced_augA.  
[reduced_augA, p] = rref(augA);
disp(reduced_augA)
%Use the pivot colulmns in reduced_augA to identify which of the original vectors are 
%included in the basis, along with which columns of the identity matrix are included in 
%the basis. Create a matrix containing the basis vectors, storing it in BasisMatrix.
pivot_columns = p;
disp(pivot_columns)
BasisMatrix = augA(:, pivot_columns)
disp(BasisMatrix)
