%Consider the matrix A.
A = [1 -2; 0 1; 1 0]

%The command svd() returns three matrices, namely the mxm orthogonal matrix U, the mxn 
%diagonal matrix S, and the nxn orthogonal matrix V, the singular value decomposition
%of A which satisfies A=USV'.
[U, S, V] = svd(A)

%Verify that the appropriate product of the matrices found using the svd() command
%results in the matrix A.  
checkA = U*S*V.'
%Use the following matrix for this activity.
      -6 8 6 9
B = [ 3 2 4 -8 ] 
    5 -4 -7 -3


%Enter the matrix B.
B = [ -6 8 6 9; 3 2 4 -8; 5 -4 -7 -3]
%Use the command svd() to find three matrices, namely the mxm orthogonal matrix U, the mxn 
%diagonal matrix S, and the nxn orthogonal matrix V, of the singular value decomposition of B.
[ U, S, V] = svd(B);
%Verify that the appropriate product of the matrices found using the svd() command
%results in the matrix B.  Store this product in checkB. 
checkB = U * S * V.';
