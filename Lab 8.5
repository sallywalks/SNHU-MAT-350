%In this activity you will use a least squares approximation to find a curve of best fit for a data set.
%Consider the four points in the plane:  (-2, 3), (-1, 1), (1, 0), and (2, 1).  Use the least squares approximation to find
%the best-fit line for this data.  
%Enter the data as two column vectors.  Note Y is the vector b in the inconsistent system Ax=b.
X = [-2 -1 1 2].'
Y = [3 1 0 1].'

%Use the length() command to determine the size of the column vector.
m = length(X)

%Set up the appropriate matrix A to find the best-fit line of the form y=C+Dx.  The first column
%of A will contain all 1's.  This is achieved here using the ones() command to create a column
%vector of length m of all 1's.  The second column of A contains X.  
A = [ones(m,1) X]

%Calculate the matrix products.
A_transposeA = A.' * A
A_transposeY = A.' * Y

%Use the backslash operation to solve the overdetermined system.
Soln1 = A_transposeA\A_transposeY

%Generate points to plot the best-fit line.  The points will range from -4 to 4 in increments of 0.1.
x=-4: 0.1 :4
ylinear = Soln1(1) + Soln1(2)*x

%The following sequence of commands plots the data and the line of best fit.
plot(x, ylinear, X, Y, 'k*');grid;shg



%The same data is used for the activity.  These are provided for you.
X = [-2 -1 1 2].'
Y = [3 1 0 1].'

%Use the length() command to determine the size of the column vector X.  Store this value in m.
m = length(X);
%Set up the appropriate matrix A to find the best-fit parabola of the form y=C+Dx+Ex^2.  The 
%first column of A will contain all 1's, using the ones() command.  The second column of A 
%contains x values that are stored in X.  The third column of A contains the squared x values
%that are stored in X.  Elementwise multiplication of X by itself, using .* operator, will 
%produce the desired values for the third column.  
A = [ones(m,1) X X.*X];
%Calculate the matrix products.  These are provided for you.
A_transposeA = A.' * A
A_transposeY = A.' * Y

%Use the backslash operation to solve the overdetermined system.  Store this in Soln2.
Soln2 = A_transposeA\A_transposeY;
%Define the x values to use for plotting the best-fit parabola.  This creates a vector x.
%This is provided for you.
x=-4: 0.1 :4;
%Define the best-fit parabola, storing it in yquadratic.  Elementwise multiplication of the
%x values times themselves to square them is achieved by using .* operator (because x is a vector). 
yquadratic = Soln2(1) + Soln2(2)*x + Soln2(3)*(x.*x);
%The following sequence of commands plots the data and the best-fit parabola.  The command is 
%provided for you.
plot(x, yquadratic, X, Y, 'k*');grid;shg
